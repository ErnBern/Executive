# About Executive
* Executive is built in Discord.js v13

* node_modules folder contains all the dependencies, you do not need to download them yourself
* To use Executive you must add your mongo URI and discord bot token in the .env fle
* You have to modify the code in order to use Executive for a different server
* Run main.py and index.js to get the full functionality of Executive
* Executive was not designed to be open sourced, hence the code has no comments
* I was learning JavaScript while making Executive so the code can be sloppy
* Executive comes with a lot of features so feel free to test it out

# Issues
Executive does not have the best command handling, so please keep in mind you will have to add some in order for it to be stable. The main issue is the clear command, I may have fixed it a bit but it still is a little unstable.
